# China

Project for Programming Technology course. Game was programmed in cooperation with https://github.com/KunickiKarol

Chinese checkers in Java 11 with ability to store games in database. Inside we use OOP, patterns such as Abstract Factory or Chain-Of-Responsibility, hibernate, client-server connection and maven. I was focused on SQL database, client's GUI and connecting the client to the server.

Here's a UML diagram of our project https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CGc5Z_iN4tG9wzTvdlPMY03SqhXfEl7f/view?usp=sharing
